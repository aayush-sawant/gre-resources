Hi all,
	I have just uploaded all the resources I used during my GRE prep. During my prep I felt it would be great if someone would just club all the main most frequently used resources, hence I have made one. Feel free to download it as and when you need. I have also included some of the essays that I practiced. Feel free to read/refer them. If you have any questions you can drop me an email at :swnt.aayush@gmail.com or sawant.aay@northeastern.edu
I also highly recommend everyone reading this to visit gregmat.com as it is one of the best websites out there on GRE prep.
I have also included "Anki" app that will help you with the learning 2000 words for gre vocab. Do check that out.
All the best for your preperation. I know you will succeed. Live long and prosper. 


Thanks,
Aayush Sawant
